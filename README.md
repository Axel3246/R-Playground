R is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is widely used among statisticians, data scientists, and researchers for developing statistical software and data analysis. R provides a variety of statistical and graphical techniques, including linear and nonlinear modeling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, and more. It is also highly extensible, allowing users to easily add new functionality through packages.

In this repository, you will find a collection of my projects, experiments, problem solving and studies in R. Feel free to browse through the repository and leave a comment if you have any questions or feedback.

Happy coding!
